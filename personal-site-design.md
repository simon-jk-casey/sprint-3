The main purpose of my site is to serve to learn web development and act as a portfolio/example of said learning.

The target audience is EDA staff and students (current cohort and potentially future), myself (in both learning and reflection) and potentially future prospective employers.

I would like my site to be clean and easy to navigate, fast to load and with some stylistic flourishes.

I will design it using the "F" idea that the most viewed areas of a page are Left to right then up and down, repeated.  I aim to use scrolling frames in my blog for both the navigation section and article section.
